# Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Visualization Project

## Overview
This project aims to visualize the distribution of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across the United States. The project utilizes data visualization techniques to provide insights into the availability and accessibility of EV charging infrastructure.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:

- Explore the geographic distribution of EV charging stations.
- Analyze the density of charging stations in different regions.
- Provide insights into the coverage of EV charging infrastructure across the US.
- Create interactive visualizations to allow users to explore and interact with the data.

## Data Source
The project utilizes data from the Electric & Alternative Fuel Charging Stations 2023 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saketpradhan/electric-and-alternative-fuel-charging-stations) This dataset contains information about the location, type, and accessibility of EV charging stations across the US.

## Technologies Used
- Python (including libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc)
- PostgreSQL (for data storage and retrieval)
- HTML/CSS (for creating interactive visualizations)
- Folium

## Project Structure
- `ev_stations_filtered4.csv`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `EV Charging Stations_DA.MZ`: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `map.html`: Contains HTML templates for web visualization.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Ethical Considerations
- In developing this project, we have taken several ethical considerations into account. We have ensured the responsible handling of data, including anonymizing any personally identifiable information to protect user privacy. Additionally, efforts have been made to address potential biases in the data and visualization methods, promoting fairness and transparency. The interactive visualizations are designed to be accessible to all users, adhering to web accessibility standards to accommodate individuals with disabilities.
